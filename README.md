# TwitterDataVisualizer
I developed a twitter data visualizer for Twitter, based
on the location most recent tweets that have geolocation information. Used
twitter framework to get most recent tweet within a 1-mile radius of userâ€™s current
location and displayed it on a map. This app continuously polls for new tweet
tweets and display them on map. Once 100 tweets are received, 10 oldest
tweets are removed.
This app was developed to play around with Twitter framework and get the best
out of it.
